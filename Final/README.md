## Spy Eye
  With PIR sensors and a servo, Spy Eye tracks and follows the movement in its surroundings. You can try to talk to it by inputting Morse Code with a button, your message will be displayed on the LCD screen.

### Process
  After midterm, I changed the idea from outputting Morse Code in sound to translating Morse input to text and display it. I used a 16 x 2 LCD screen and tried to use button and capacitive touch sensor as the input method. The button turned out to work better. In the final version I have one button as the input key and another as the clear button.
