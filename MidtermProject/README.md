## Midterm Project

### The Eye (In progress)

The project is an illuminating eye (in the final version) that tracks and follows people's movement around it. It is also capable of telling the time, triggered by touching. </br>
At this stage there are two PIR sensors installed and the servo would rotate to the direction in which movement is detected. A piezo is triggered by a capacitive sensorm but right now it only makes a constant sound. </br>
